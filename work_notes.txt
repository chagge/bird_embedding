Two  directions to consider:

1. rich representation of users. Especially, users have strong temporal-spatial relations. We will explore of how to use these features and how to smooth the embedding over the temporal-spatial space.   
2. Need stronger explanatory power of the model, so we can explain the community of birds.   


TODO: 

The next step is to use exponential family embedding to test the data 
Plot the embedding of birds
