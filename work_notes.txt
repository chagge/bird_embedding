Two  directions to consider:

1. rich representation of users. Especially, users have strong temporal-spatial relations. We will explore of how to use these features and how to smooth the embedding over the temporal-spatial space.   
2. Need stronger explanatory power of the model, so we can explain the community of birds.   


TODO: 

[Done] Run cofactor model on data groupped by stixels 
[Done] Plot the embedding of birds

[Done] Derive the inference method for P-EMB with exposure model 
[Working on]Test P-EMB with a small dataset
[Done] Plot with tSNE

[Working on] report experiment results
1. compare three settings:
1) no downweighting zeros
2) downweighting zeros without covariates 
2) downweighting zeros with covariates 

problem: some fold get extremely large values. Find the instance causing the problem

2. compare scaling the context

3. compare poisson distribution with intercept term and without it  

4. compare number of components

5. compare parameter settings of sigma 

6. plot one embedding of birds
