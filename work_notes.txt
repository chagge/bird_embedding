Two  directions to consider:

1. rich representation of users. Especially, users have strong temporal-spatial relations. We will explore of how to use these features and how to smooth the embedding over the temporal-spatial space.   
2. Need stronger explanatory power of the model, so we can explain the community of birds.   


TODO: 

[Done] Run cofactor model on data groupped by stixels 
[Done] Plot the embedding of birds

Derive the inference method for P-EMB with exposure model 
Test P-EMB with a small dataset
