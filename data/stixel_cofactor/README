This fold contains data generated from running cofactor model on the matrix of stixel-species co-occurances. 

1. The files aggregated_obs_20xx are obtained by grouping observations by stixels and binarizing values 
2. Most other files are intermediate result
3. Final result are stored in files in ML20M_ns1_scale*. The V matrix of the last iteration is the embedding result.
